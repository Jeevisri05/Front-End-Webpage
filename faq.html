        <br>
    5-Year Integrated programme is part of an innovative attempt to provide advanced courses for students and offer two degrees â€“ B.Tech. & M.Tech. in 5 years. This not only reduces one-year but also provides adequate opportunities for Ph.D. enrolment. The 5-Year Integrated programme is offered in a specialization area along with a major UG engineering discipline. The student studies along with the regular 4-year course students upto 7th semester and proceeds to complete PG courses in 8th & 9th semester and project work in the 10th semester. At the end of 5 years, he / she graduates with a B.Tech. & M.Tech. degree. For example, 5-Year Integrated M.Tech. in Advanced Manufacturing means, a student studies B.Tech. Mechanical till 7th semester and completed Advanced Mfg courses in 8th & 9th semesters and completes project in 10th semester. After successful completion, a B.Tech. in Mechanical and M.Tech. in Advanced Manufacturing is awarded. There is no exit option at the end of the 4th year.
