A sublime melange of style and substance, glamour and colour, Kuruksastra, SASTRA's cultural bonanza consists of arts, music, literary events(English, Tamil and Hindi) and dance. Top Institutes from all over India turn up to give fierce competition to each other in the race to win the ultimate prize- the title of overall championship at Kuruksastra.
